This project is about 

This project analyzes sales data for a fictional but realistic home décor e-commerce store. The dataset
contains customer orders for products such as wall art, rugs, lamps, cushions, vases, mirrors, and
small furniture. The goal of the project is to create a complete data pipeline: prepare a noisy dataset,
clean it using Power Query, and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard to understand customer
trends, top-performing categories, and overall business performance.
